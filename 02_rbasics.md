<strong>Objective:</strong> learn some R basics.
</p>

## Online interactive course
**Recommanded:** Go to [tryr](http://tryr.codeschool.com), an online interactive course (that does not require any R installation). *Required time: about 40 min*

## R language cheat sheets

* **Recommanded:** [R base cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/r-cheat-sheet-3.pdf)
* [R Cran reference card for intermediate users](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf)
 

## Some good online books to learn R

* [Introduction to R](http://colinfay.me/intro-to-r/)
* [R for data science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience)

## R documentation/help

<p class="message">It is very helpful to use the R-documentation</p>

Check the documentation to know how to use a specific function:
```r
?mean
```
Search the help files for a word or phrase. 
```r
help.search("weighted mean")
```

Ask your friend google... he will take care of you (and your data)!
```
R Cran weighted mean
```
I always write `R Cran` instead of `R` alone because it works better.
